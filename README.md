## Learn Rust! Build the ultimate server template!

you can pass PORT env variable to change default port to run at,
so the run script is as follows

```bash
export PORT=4444
cargo run
 ```


and you can see your changes without manually recompiling server thanks to ```cargo watch```.

### Goals
1. To write server template
2. To be able to run in docker
